I reinstituted (again...) the links page. This time the number of
links is very small, and the web page leads to different sites than
the gopher menu. Hopefully this time I'll keep that. [links]

I also recently bought a cheap diginal photo camera. I was (from
description) expecting it to have a microusb interface, but
unfortunately I had to lift the ban on usb-c in my room after less
than a year. I made a few [photos] already and uploaded them to ftp.
Perhaps later I'll organise them somehow on the web site.
