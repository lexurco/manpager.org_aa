This is some info about myself, that I didn't feel like putting into my
~/.project. A mini-autobiography of sorts. If you want things like my
contact info, please finger(1) aa at this server, or see project.txt on

TIMELINE

My memories of what has happend before 2014 are a bit foggy, so that may
be not entirely accurate.

2000: get born in Moscow
2005: finally manage to pronounce the Russian rhotic sound! still hate
      it, though
2007: first year at school, first enemies
2008: the teacher tells us to be quiet; other children violate that
      order immediately; I don't join; I am punished along with the rest
      anyway; 
2011: switch Minecraft to English; most other programs on my computer
      are soon to follow
2013: learn a bit of HTML; love it, but don't know what to do with it
2014: Putin annexes Crimea; the ruble plummets, and everyone starts
      hating Ukrainians; I begin googling "how to emmigrate"
2015: move to a different school, get familiar with Pascal
2016: switch to Python
2018: graduate from school only to immediately get into a cybersecurity
      bachelor program to avoid army conscription
2020: install Linux for the first time (later I mostly switch to
      OpenBSD), begin reading lots of nonfiction, and actually doing
      stuff besides playing video games
2022: Putin invades Ukraine, and I get my bachelor's diploma; instead of
      going for a master's, I go for a job, because the IT and CS
      workers are now exempt from conscription; I soon realise my
      hatered for the job
2023: notice that I have "just about enough" money; secretely prepare
      the documents, and on the last work day of the year, I tell the
      boss I'm leaving
2024: I am renting an appartment in Kutaisi, and working a remote job;
      so far so good...


A LITTLE ABOUT ME

My name is Alexander. I am a free software developer, a cosmopolite, an
explorer and a life-long learner.


FUTURE

At the moment I write this, I've been outside of my birth country for
about 3 months, and I love it! The beginning was a bit of a struggle,
but I am finally set up to work on many of long-delayed projects. I'll
be sure to post the updates in my ~/.plan!
