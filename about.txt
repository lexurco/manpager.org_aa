This is some info about myself, that I didn't feel like putting into my
~/.project. A mini-autobiography of sorts. If you want things like my
contact info, please finger(1) aa at this server, or see project.txt on
the web/gopher/gemini.


TIMELINE

My memories of what has happened before 2014 are a bit foggy, so that may
be not entirely accurate.

2000: get born in Moscow
2005: finally manage to pronounce the Russian rhotic sound! still hate
      it after, though
2007: first year at school, first enemies
2008: the teacher tells us to be quiet; other children violate that
      order immediately; I don't join; I am punished along with the rest
      anyway; I begin internalising a disdain for authority
2011: switch Minecraft to English; most other programs on my computer
      are soon to follow
2013: learn a bit of HTML; love it, but don't know what to do with it
2014: Putin annexes Crimea; the ruble plummets, and everyone starts
      hating Ukrainians; I begin googling "how to emigrate"
2015: move to a different school, get familiar with Pascal
2016: switch to Python
2018: graduate from school only to immediately get into a cybersecurity
      bachelor program to avoid army conscription
2020: install Linux for the first time (later I mostly switch to
      OpenBSD), begin reading lots of nonfiction, and actually doing
      stuff besides playing video games
2022: Putin invades Ukraine, and I get my bachelor's diploma; instead of
      going for a master's, I go for a job, because the IT and CS
      workers are now exempt from conscription; I soon realise my
      hatred for the job
2023: notice that I have "just about enough" money; secretly prepare
      the documents, and on the last work day of the year, I tell the
      boss I'm leaving
2024: I am renting an apartment in Kutaisi, working a remote job, and
      meeting people from England and New Zealand; so far so good...


A LITTLE ABOUT ME

My name is Alexander. I am a free software developer, a cosmopolite, an
explorer and a life-long learner.


FUTURE

At the moment I write this, I've been outside of my birth country for
months, and I love it! The beginning was a bit of a struggle, but I am
finally set up to work on many of long-delayed projects. I'll be sure to
post the updates in my ~/.plan!


LESSONS LEARNED

When I was about 21, it dawned upon me that a lot of the things I used
to believe were false, and a lot of the rules I used to live by had a
negative influence on me. Here are a few things I learned from my
mistakes (and successes) so far:

- Disregard unsolicited advice, specifically:
  + Never believe absolute statements. (Even this one ;)
  + Never believe people who say that something is impossible.
- Believe in yourself. No one else will. But if you do you'll be able
  to achieve anything you want.
  + But don't confuse belief with wishful thinking. These are completely
    different things.
- Freedom is the best.
- If you are in a bad environment, change it.
- Raw intellect might get you through the basics, but it's never enough
  for important things. When you set your mind to something, spend your
  time preparing, or you'll miss all the opportunities.
- Take walks.
- Read books.
