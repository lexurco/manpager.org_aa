ON OPENBSD

At the time of writing, Alpine Linux 3.20.1 is the most recent. You can
get a URL relevant to you from https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/, or by
exploring a mirror in a web browser.

$ ftp https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.20/releases/x86_64/alpine-virt-3.20.1-x86_64.iso
$ vmctl create -s 5G alpine.qcow2 # or .img
# vmctl start -cL -d alpine.qcow2 -B cdrom -m 1G -r alpine-virt-3.20.1-x86_64.iso alpine


ON ALPINE

Below is a transcript of installation. My comments are offered in
parentheses, all caps (LIKE SO).

Welcome to Alpine Linux 3.20
Kernel 6.6.34-1-virt on an x86_64 (/dev/ttyS0)

localhost login: root
(NO PASSWORD)
Welcome to Alpine!

The Alpine Wiki contains a large amount of how-to guides and general
information about administrating Alpine systems.
See <https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/>.

You can setup the system with the command: setup-alpine

You may change this message by editing /etc/motd.

localhost:~# setup-alpine

 Disk & Install
----------------
Available disks are:
  vda   (21.5 GB 0x0b5d )

Which disk(s) would you like to use? (or '?' for help or 'none') [none] vda

The following disk is selected:
  vda   (21.5 GB 0x0b5d )

How would you like to use it? ('sys', 'data', 'crypt', 'lvm' or '?' for help) [?] ?

You can select between 'sys', 'data', 'crypt', 'cryptsys', 'lvm', 'lvmsys'
or 'lvmdata'.

sys:
  This mode is a traditional disk install. The following partitions will be
  created on the disk: /boot, / (filesystem root) and swap.

  This mode may be used for development boxes, desktops, virtual servers, etc.

data:
  This mode uses your disk(s) for data storage, not for the operating system.
  The system itself will run from tmpfs (RAM).

  Use this mode if you only want to use the disk(s) for a mailspool, databases,
  logs, etc.

crypt:
  Enable encryption with cryptsetup and ask again for 'sys' or 'data'.
  You will be prompted to enter a decryption password, and will need to
  use this password to boot up the operating system after installation.

cryptsys:
  Same as 'sys' but also enable encryption.

lvm:
  Enable logical volume manager and ask again for 'sys' or 'data'.

lvmsys:
  Same as 'sys' but use logical volume manager for partitioning.

lvmdata:
  Same as 'data' but use logical volume manager for partitioning.


The following disk is selected:
  vda   (21.5 GB 0x0b5d )

How would you like to use it? ('sys', 'data', 'crypt', 'lvm' or '?' for help) [?] sys

WARNING: The following disk(s) will be erased:
  vda   (21.5 GB 0x0b5d )

WARNING: Erase the above disk(s) and continue? (y/n) [n] y
Creating file systems...
Installing system on /dev/vda3:
/mnt/boot is device /dev/vda1
==> initramfs: creating /boot/initramfs-virt for 6.6.41-0-virt
/boot is device /dev/vda1

Installation is complete. Please reboot.
alpine:~# poweroff

(IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO USE '~.'.)


BACK ON OPENBSD

First check that the VM has stopped correctly:

$ vmctl status
   ID   PID VCPUS  MAXMEM  CURMEM     TTY        OWNER    STATE NAME

And start without the CD-ROM:

# vmctl start -cL -d alpine.qcow2 -m 1G alpine

Network should work. From alpine try 'ping 8.8.8.8',
'ping google.com' and 'ip a'. From OpenBSD try pinging whatever 'ip a'
shows (should be 100.64.X.X). If that works, you should be able to
'ssh jd@$IP'.
