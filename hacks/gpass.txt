gpass is a secure passphrase generator, written in C. The generated
passphrases look like so:

chirping landing luckily dollar gnat expert

By default, passphrases are generated with pretty high entropy of 70,
and the EFF long dictionary [0] is used, but that's configurable at run
time.

The program uses arc4random(3), so it should work on BSD and GNU
systems.

You can download one of the releases at [1], clone the git repository
via [2], or browse it at [3].
