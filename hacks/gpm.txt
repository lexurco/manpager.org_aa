gpm is a Unix secret (or password) manager, similar to pass [0], written
in perl.

Unlike pass, gpm doesn't depend on bash, and supports arbitrary
directory depth (>=0) instead of always insisting on the depth of 1.

You can download one of the releases at [1], clone the git repository
via [2], or browse it at [3].
