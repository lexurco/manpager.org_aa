gpm is a Unix password-manager, similar to pass [0].

The motivation for writing this was as follows:

1. not having a dependency on bash;
2. storing each password in /path/to/storage/foo.gpg, rather than
   /path/to/storage/foo/bar.gpg;

For those, who actually like the way pass handles 2., I may in the
future add optional support for subdirectories of arbitrary depth. For
now, I recommend checking out plass [1].

The script is curretly written in Bourne shell, with no non-POSIX
dependencies to my knowledge. I may in future rewrite it in perl to
avoid things like passwords showing up in ps(1).

You can download one of the releases at [2], clone the git repository
via [3], or browse it at [4].
