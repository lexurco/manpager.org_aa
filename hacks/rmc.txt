rmc is a mailcap [0] implementation, written in perl.

rmc is intended to be more general-purpose, than the original RFC
suggests, and be useful in situations where xdg-open [1] may be
useful. The implementation is not 100%-compliant: some parts of the RFC
are intentionally violated.

You can download one of the releases at [2], clone the git repository
via [3], or browse it at [4].
