xitems is a pop-up menu for X, written in C with Xlib.

It receives a menu description on stdin, and prints the chosen item on
stdout. Items can be selected with mouse, or with keyboard shortcuts.

It's one of the first X11 clients I've written, so the design may be a
bit rough.

You can download one of the releases at [0], clone the git repository
via [1], or browse it at [2].
