Living in the beautiful city of Kutaisi since January 2024 (right by the
opera house too)!

Got a remote job now. Hourly income multiplied 34 times! (Monthly by
less impressive 2.) Probably not very sustainable long-term. Planning
my next move.

My attempt to study Georgian didn't go much beyond learning the
alphabet. Trying a different approach with Serbian. Will probably stay
in Novi Sad for the next year.

Found out about all the cool expat gatherings. Making lots of cool
friends!

Trying to tackle free software codebases of various sizes. Especially,
the programs in the OpenBSD source tree.

Recording business (and other) ideas in my notebook. Will have to start
testing some of that stuff soon.

Trying to cold-email interesting people.

I wrote a new article in thoughts/240505.youth_sucks.txt, called
"Youth sucks (but adulthood and beyond don't have to)". It's pretty
short and to the point, as usual, but it is something I wanted to write
about for a long time. Enjoy!

Hello, friends. Something very tragic has happened recently. I don't
know if I'll manage to keep the site updated, but I will try, since it
seems to help a bit.

I added a new article in art/015.cron_tricks.txt
