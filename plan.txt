Having finally *e*mmigrated, trying to figure out *i*mmigration. At this
point I really don't know where it'll go, get back to me in 2027.

Reading lots of books, mostly English-language non-fiction from real
dead-tree paper.

Trying to figure out how to stop relying on an employer, and become an
enterpreneur. (I know -- boring!)

Meeting lots of new cool people. Speaking (i.e. with my mouth) more
English than ever.

Finally getting back into the habit of creating stuff: writing software,
drawing, etc.

I wrote a new article in thoughts/240505.youth_sucks.txt, called
"Youth sucks (but adulthood and beyond don't have to)". It's pretty
short and to the point, as usual, but it is something I wanted to write
about for a long time. Enjoy!

Hello, friends. Something very tragic has happened recently. I don't
know if I'll manage to keep the site updated, but I will try, since it
seems to help a bit.

I added a new article in art/015.cron_tricks.txt
