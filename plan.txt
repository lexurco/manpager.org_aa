Living in the beautiful city of Kutaisi since January 2024!

5 months into the year, I finally managed to get out of my head, get a
remote job and start doing something! Actually, still thinking what's
the best way of dealing with the newfound income.

I bought a textbook on the Georgian language, and a dictionary. So far,
learning the language proves much more challenging than any other I've
studied before, but much more fun as well! At the very moment, I am
struggling with the alphabet.

I began inspecting the tmux source code. I have a few ideas on how the
program might be improved. Might send some patches on the ML at some
point.

I am reading 12 Rules for Life by Jordan B. Peterson. Found it at a
local book shop. So far seems pretty good. I also orderd a bunch of
books from America.

I wrote a new article in thoughts/240505.youth_sucks.txt, called
"Youth sucks (but adulthood and beyond don't have to)". It's pretty
short and to the point, as usual, but it is something I wanted to write
about for a long time. Enjoy!
