Living in the beautiful city of Kutaisi since January 2024!

5 months into the year, I finally managed to get out of my head, get a
remote job and start doing something! Actually, still thinking what's
the best way of dealing with the newfound income.

My attempt to study Georgian didn't go much beyond learning the
alphabet. I am now trying a different approach with Serbian. I think
I'll stay in Novi Sad for the next year.

Found out about all the cool expat gatherings. First real friends in
years!

I began inspecting the tmux source code. I have a few ideas on how the
program might be improved. Might send some patches on the ML at some
point.

Reading The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss. Really interesting stuff,
especially fear-setting.

Wanted to write an article on using locales and wchar_t in C, but ended
up writing two:

I wrote a new article in thoughts/240505.youth_sucks.txt, called
"Youth sucks (but adulthood and beyond don't have to)". It's pretty
short and to the point, as usual, but it is something I wanted to write
about for a long time. Enjoy!
