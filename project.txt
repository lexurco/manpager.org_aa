I live in Moscow.

I speak Russian and English. I also speak some German, French and
Esperanto.

Currently I am spending most of my free time learning French.

In my enslaved time (that's 6 to 17 from Monday to Friday, Moscow
time) I'm working as a researcher for the information security
company Infotecs. I will consider changing for some remote
employment.

Contacts:
The fastest way to contact me is via e-mail aa@manpager.org. You can
also use matrix @aa:4d2.org. I am sometimes (rarely) present on
libera.chat as aamanpager. I am also aa on tilde.institute.

I am https://github.com/aamanpager/ and https://aa.tilde.institute/.

On other sites I am usually known as aamanpager. <sarcasm>Use that
name yourself, and I'll kill you personally.</sarcasm>
