I live in Moscow.

I speak Russian and English. I also speak some German, French and
Esperanto.

Currently I am spending most of my free time learning French. When I
think I speak sufficiently well, I think of either continuing with
some other human language, or learning lisp.

In my enslaved time (that's 6 to 17 from Monday to Friday) I'm working
as a researcher for the information security company Infotecs. I will
consider changing for some remote employment.
