I live in Moscow.

I speak Russian and English. I also speak some German, French and
Esperanto.

Currently I am spending most of my free time learning French.

In my enslaved time (that's 6 to 17 from Monday to Friday, Moscow
time) I'm working as a researcher for the information security
company Infotecs. I will consider changing for some remote
employment.
