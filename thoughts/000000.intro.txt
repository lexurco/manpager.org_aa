Originally, I created this site with a "blogs are kind of stupid"
mindset. So instead I decided to publish "articles" in the art
directory. That has worked pretty well, especially because I only had
little time to maintain any of it.

Things are different now. Firstly, I have some thoughts that I'd like to
share, which I can't really put into an "article". More importantly, I
expect to finally have time to do that, and other things I always wanted
to do.

In short, thoughts is the "blog" part of this site.
